# RivalLang

RivalLang is my attempt to see how hard is it to make a programing language.
Inspired by Jonathan Blow's JAI programing language and rants.

Created a lexer and parser but stopped at typechecking.
You can't run it but it will create a Abstract Syntax Tree.

# Syntax:

## Function Implementation
Syntax: 

## Variable declaration
Syntax: identifier type;

Example: foo u32;

`foo` is the variable name and `u32` is the type name.
